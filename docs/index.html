      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I implement a basic cloth simulator. The underlying model is a grid of pointmasses spanned by springs
        of various types and strengths. With each task, I make additions to the basic model in order to make it more realistic,
        such as implementing collisions and adding textures.
      </p>

    <a class="anchor" id="part1"></a>
        <h2>Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
            <p>
              To start off, we begin creating the cloth by defining the
              <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/lecture/19-18/physical-simulation">underlying structure</a> of the material.
              Since cloth is an elastic material, we first set up a grid of pointmasses, then connect the pointmasses by springs.
              This allows us to simulate the overall motion of the cloth by calculating the local external and internal forces affecting each
              pointmass, then modifying its position and velocity by the laws of physics (and some approximations). This is done in
              future parts. For now, the finished cloth grid can be seen by the below pictures.
            </p>

        <h2>Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
          <p>
            With the springs and pointmasses ready, we can begin simulating the movement of the cloth as external forces such as gravity
            act on it. To do this, there are three discrete steps:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Calculate all the external forces acting on the cloth and add the force to each individual pointmass.</li>
              <li>Use <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/lecture/19-36/physical-simulation">Verlet Integration</a> to numerically
              integrate the acceleration and velocity and update the positions for every pointmass in the cloth.</li>
              <li>Constrain position updates to uphold physical realism as defined by this
                <a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S14/papers/provot_cloth_simulation_96.pdf">paper</a>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            With these physical principles implemented, we can now realistically simulate the cloth falling in real time. We can also
            explore and validate our physical model by observing what happens when we vary properties of the underlying structure, such
            as spring constant and damping force.

          <p>
            In the first set of images, the spring constant is varied.
            The higher the spring constant, the stiffer the springs. As a result, the cloth as a whole is stiffer. This is
            most easily seen in how the top edge of the cloth dips less in the higher spring constant case than the lower spring constant case.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second set of images, the damping ratio is varied. The damping ratio dictates the spring's energy conservation
            by modifying the friction coefficient. In the first image, since there is less friction, the cloth actually swings past
            its lowest point and exhibits some pendulum motion as it converges to its resting state much more slowly. By contrast,
            with the higher damping ratio the cloth quickly falls to rest from it's initial horizontal state.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the last set of images, the density of the pointmasses is varied. With lower density, the springs have less force
            pushing them away from their resting states, so the cloth doesn't droop as much. However, with high density, the heavy
            weight of the pointmasses weighs down the springs and causes much more expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally below are some pictures of the cloth with its 4 corners pinned in its final resting state. Pretty!

      <h2>Part 3: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Now we want to make the cloth mesh able to interact with its environment. To do this, we need to implement
        collision algorithms to make sure the cloth doesn't clip into other objects and interacts with them as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two algorithms implemented are sphere collision and plane collision. Upon collision with either object, we
        "pop" the cloth back up to the side of the object that the cloth was originally on by applying a correction to its position
        after it has been calculated via the Verlet integration implemented in Part 2. The below pictures display the cloth
        resting on each object rather than clipping through it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Observe the differences in the cloth stretch due to varying the spring constant. Just like in Part 2, lower spring constant results
        in more stretch, while higher spring constant results in less stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plane collision can also be seen below:

      <h2>Part 4: Handling Self Collisions</h2>
      <p>
        We've handled collisions with other objects but we also can't forget handling collisions between the cloth and itself!
        This is actually a bit more complicated than collisions with other objects, because we can't just compute collisions individually
        for every pointmass in the cloth; instead we have to compute collisions between every <i>pair</i> of pointmasses in the cloth, greatly
        increasing the time complexity. One such solution, which is implemented here, is to use a hashtable instead, where each key in the table
        represents a particular volumetric region in the cloth containing all the pointmasses in that region. In this manner, we don't need
        to test against every pointmass, but rather only the nearby pointmasses. Thus, for every time step, a spatial map of the cloth is built,
        and then collisions are calculated using the map. If a collision occurs between two point masses, then they are moved a set distance apart
        from each other. The below screenshots show a vertical cloth falling onto a plane while exhibiting no clipping. The first column is
        the default reference, while the second column exhibits low density and the third column exhibits low spring constant.

    <p>
      Just like in Part 2, lowering the density causes the springs to be relatively stronger and so the mesh is much
      less inflexible. It has less intermediate folds and is overall flatter. Meanwhile, lowering the spring constant
      has the opposite effect and the cloth exhibits more folding as the springs are weaker and the cloth has less structural
      support.
    </p>

    <a class="anchor" id="part5"></a>
    <h2>Part 5: Handling Self Collisions</h2>
    <p>
      In Part 5 I implemented shaders using OpenGL shaders and the GLSL language. The shaders implemented were
      Diffuse, Blinn-Phong, Texture Mapping, Bump & Displacement Map, and Mirror shaders. The implementations all followed
      from the ones discussed in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two basic OpenGL shader types used are vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders are used to take in a vertex,
      then transform its properties accordingly so that it can be passed into the fragment shader, which assigns the final color
      of the vertex. Thus, the two work together to produce a texture across the entire cloth.
    <h4>Blinn-Phong Shading</h4>
    <p>
      The first major model implemented is the Blinn-Phong model. Ambient, diffuse, and specular lights are individually computed per vertex,
      then the three are superimposed together to prdouce the final output. In this way, Blinn-Phong produces smooth and realistic shading.
      Ambient light is assumed to be naturally coming from the environment, and specular highlights are computed taking into account the
      location of the light source in the scene. Displayed below are the three components of Blinn-Phong, as well as the final result
      gained from adding all three factors together.

      The texture mapping shader was also implemented by sampling the texture proportionally, much like Barycentric coordinates.
      By extension, the mirror mapping shader is actually very similar to texture mapping, but with a precomputed reflection in
      order to sample the texture at its reflected position instead.

      In bump mapping and displacement mapping, the normals of the object itself is modified before being passed into
      the fragment shader in order to give the illusion of bumpy textures. Elevation change is computed by observing
      the frequency change in the corresponding portion of the texture; higher frequency change means higher elevation change.
      Finally, displacement mapping comes only with the added addition of modifying the positions of the vertices as well
      to create a rougher looking geometry. After recalculating the vertices and normals, Blinn-Phong shading is applied as before.
      The images below illustrate each of these. The custom texture used was a 5000x3000 image of wood planks.

      Although it is difficult to see due to the high resolution and horizontally uniform texture that I ended up using,
      varying the resolution of the sphere changes the number of individual texture cells that are mapped onto the sphere.
      For some less uniform textures, this can have a significant effect on how the texture looks on the sphere and other objects.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This concludes Cloth Simulator! We have only scratched the surface of physical simulation, but this was nonetheless an
      interesting project. In the future, I'd like to try simulations such as liquid, smoke, and phase changes. Until next time!
