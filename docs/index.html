    <h1 align="middle">Final Project: Real Time Melting Simulation Using Springs</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Michael Ren & Mathew Han, CS184-su20</h2>

    <a class="anchor" id="abstract"></a>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a real time melting simulation in Unity by using spring joints and point masses. The rationale behind our implementation relates to how intermolecular forces act between particles at an atomic level. The spring constant represents the strength of intermolecular forces between particles, and the lattice structure of our cube is similar to the metalic bonds within metals. We can simulate this at a macro level using spring joints and larger point masses. 
            </p>

        <a class="anchor" id="technical_approach"></a>
        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>
              For our simulator, we start off by setting up all of the appropriate point masses 
              and constraints required. After that, we can begin running the simulation. At each timestep, 
              the temperature of each point mass and the spring constant of each spring is updated to reflect
              the propagation of heat throughout the lattice structure.
            </p>
          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
          The pseudocode below gives an overview of each step of the process:
              <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap">
      void Start() {  // called once at the beginning of execution
        buildStructure();  // initialize the point masses  
        addStructuralSprings();
        addShearingSprings();
        assignTemps(); 
      }

      void Update() {  // called once per timestep 
        updateTemps(); 
        updateSprings(); 
        vibrateSpheres(); 
        updateColors(); 
      }
              </code>
            <p>
              In practice, construction of both types of springs was done together. Temperature assignments were 
              also organized within the initial structure construction for the sake of brevity, although the process
              outlined in the pseudocode would definitely work better for the sake of flexibility. The rest
              of the code was organized as outlined above, although many of the loops in the 
              <code>Update()</code> could be combined into one if desired.
            </p>

      <h3>Task 1: Constructing the Lattice Structure</h3>
        <p>
          The lattice was created by attaching a script to an empty <code>GameObject</code> that generated a 
          3D array of sphere masses. Each of these sphere masses were given their own <code>Rigidbody</code> 
          and connected to its (up to 26) neighbors using a one-way spring joint. Unlike Project 4 (ClothSim), 
          we wanted to simulate a metal rather than a weightless cloth, so we used a high spring constant to 
          make the cube appear solid and a higher mass per particle.
        </p>

        <div align="middle">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="images/melter/birdseye.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
                <figcaption align="middle">Bird's eye view of the cube.</figcaption>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>

          <p>
            One of the biggest issues that we came across while implementing the structure was that the 
            masses were too far apart from each other initially. If we applied too much external force, 
            the box would explode and particles would fly everywhere on the screen. We fixed this by 
            increasing the mass of each particle so that it would take more force to move a spring, as 
            well as decreasing the average distance between each particle. 
          </p>

          <div align="middle">
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <img src="images/melter/info.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
                </td>
                <td>
                  <img src="images/melter/objects.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>
            Some other more trivial issues that arose with our implementation came with how we designed 
            the cube. Initially, we were only going to use structural spring joints, but the cube 
            would simply fall apart. We later added in planar and 3D shearing to address this problem. 
            In addition, Unity has only one way spring joints by default, so we had to apply spring 
            joints for each point mass in one direction, unlike ClothSim where it was done in pairs. 
          </p>

          <h3>Task 2: Simulating heat propagation</h3>
          
          <p>
            With the construction of the cube done, the next step was to implement heat propagation. 
            In order to do this, we made use of the proportionality given by the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation">heat equation</a>: 
            <b>the rate of temperature change at a point is directly proportional to the how much hotter 
            or cooler the surrounding material at that point is.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the real heat equation, this proportionality is represented by the Laplacian. For our 
            purposes, we attempted to approximate this temperature delta by computing a weighted average
            of temperatures out of the point masses directly connected to any given point by springs. This
            means that our weighted average was computed from (at most) 26 adjacent points masses. 
          </p>

          <p>
            With that in mind, we were still pleasantly surprised by the results: 
          </p>

          <div align="middle" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; overflow: hidden;">
            <img src="images/melter/melting_3.gif" align="middle" width="90%"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Constant heat applied from the left.</figcaption>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the above example, constant heat was applied from the left side of the metal bar
            throughout the span of the simulation. Notice how initially, the bar is all blue 
            except for the the red block on the left, then the heat gradually spreads across the bar. 
            We also used cubes as our primitive here rather than spherical point masses
            for better visual results, as we had not implemented melting yet so the shape didn't matter.
            To color the cubes, we created a lerp based on the temperature of the individual primitive, 
            which was on a scale from 0-100, with 0 corresponding to blue (cold) and 100 correspoinding to 
            red (hot). Initially our lerp was done in RGB values, but the visual results were not aesthetically
            pleasing. As a result, we switched to the HSV spectrum seen above. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For the next simulation, we attempted to benchmark it by comparing our results to 
            the mathematically generated results from a YouTube video by 3Blue1Brown. The setup 
            we employed was to have a fixed hot and cold point on the left and right respectively. 
            For all the in between points we had the left half start hot, and the right half start cold, 
            but we let them vary freely throughout the simulation. As far as we can tell, this is identical
            to the setup employed by 3Blue1Brown and our results are very similar. Both simulations can 
            be seen below for comparison:

          <p>
            We ran our simulation for longer than 3Blue1Brown, which explains why we end up with 
            a wider spectrum of colors.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the largest problems we encountered was how we wanted to simulate the heat 
            propagation itself. Initially, we tried energy based radiation using the Stefan-Boltzmann 
            Law, but we ran into issues with conservation of energy. As the simulation continued running, 
            the temperatures would increase exponentially until they became <code>NaN</code>. Since we 
            didn't want to go through the hassle of keeping track of the energy from heat loss and the 
            energy from heat transfer, we went with the heat equation approach.
          </p>

          <h3>Task 3: Applying melting</h3>
          <p>
            To implement the melting effect, we used an empirically derived curve from 
            <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1241122">Thermal Degradation of Extension Springs</a>. 
            Since the paper didn't provide an explicit formula for their regression, we approximated it 
            using a cubic spline. The formula would be applied to springs constants of the outgoing 
            spring joints of each particle mass, causing hotter particles to have weaker springs over 
            time. The cube itself would become less structurally stable because of the shift in spring 
            forces, causing the melting effect that we wanted to simulate.
          </p>

          <div align="middle">
            <img src="images/melter/curve.png" align="middle" width="70%" />
            <figcaption align="middle">

            </figcaption>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
            However, the formula only mapped temperature directly to the spring constant of the 
            Elgiloy spring. We transformed the constant into a ratio that could be applied directly 
            onto any spring constant (we assume all of our springs have similar spring constant curve 
            to the Elgiloy spring). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, despite lowering the spring constant, the cube itself would be entirely at rest by 
            the time it was heated enough for the formula to have an impact. As a result, we had to 
            apply microforces to each particle (vibrations) in order for the structure to actually melt. 
            Below are some of our initial simulations of the melting.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first example, we apply constant heat to the entire bottom layer of point masses. The 
            video below is sped up by five times:
          </p>
          <div align="middle" >
           <video width="660" height="360" controls>
              <source src="media/layeredited.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
           </video>
          </div>
          <p>
            Note that although we get some very pretty results, there is some bouncing in the point masses
            due to our spring model. This is even more apparent in the next example, in which we start 
            by heating the center "core" of the lattice/metal. This video is also sped up by five times:
          </p>
          <div align="middle">
           <video width="660" height="360" controls>
            <source src="media/centeredited.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
         </video>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the larger simulation, the lattice is being held together almost unnaturally in addition to 
            the springiness. For our final deliverables, we resolved this by putting tighter restrictions 
            on our spring scaling logic through clamping.

    <a class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In the end, we are very satisfied with the results of our project. In summary, we were able to 
        implement the following in the past two weeks: 
        <ul class="nav flex-column" style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>Construct a metal lattice model</li>
          <li>Implement, visualize, and test heat propagation through the lattice</li>
          <li>Compute, implement, and refine spring scaling within the lattice</li>
          <li>Create a (in our opinion) reasonably accurate real time melting simulator</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there are still many improvements which can be made. Some of the things we weren't able to 
        get to in these two weeks included adding more textures, improving the model, optimizing it, and 
        implementing different types of materials. For the latter in particular, this may prove to be difficult
        as the molecular structure of nonmetals is much more varying than that of metals. However, it is 
        a worthy improvement to think about and pursue. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, as with all of the other projects done in this class, we had a lot of fun completing the final
        project. We're very grateful to Ben, Cecilia, Vivien, and the entire rest of the course staff for 
        making this one of the most rewarding and well organized courses we've ever taken. Thank you for 
        everything!
